    "If we want to estimate the population mean, we have to make a few choices. As we've seen, larger sample sizes produce more narrow confidence intervals, meaning we have a more precise estimate. However, larger samples are more expensive to take in real life (you have to spend either more time or more money to get more data in your sample). As such, in practice you'll typically decide up front how wide your interval is allowed to be, and then set to work creating a sample of sufficient size to produce an interval of that width. If you were to choose a smaller sample size, your interval would not be narrow enough to provide the required accuracy, a larger sample size will cost more money to provide accuracy you already decided you didn't need. So, how do we choose the correct size? \n",
