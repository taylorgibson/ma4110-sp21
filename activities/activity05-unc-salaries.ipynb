Because it is a snapshot, the database may not accurately reflect an employee's permanent salary or all sources of funding provided throughout the year. As examples, the database may not capture all external fund sources that may compensate some employees, or the information may capture temporary salary increases or temporary title changes for additional duties for an employee that could change in the course of the year.\n",

    ">**What if I have questions about an employee's salary or other personnel information?** If you believe that information about a particular employee is inaccurate or if you have other questions about the information provided in the database, you may contact the HR department at the constituent institution to verify the employee's salary.\n",

    ">**Why do we publish this data?** Employee salaries are public and we believe that publishing salaries benefits both the public by providing easily accessible salary information and the employing institutions by minimizing public personnel information requests.\n",
